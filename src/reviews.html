                We couldn't be happier with our decision to use Castles in The Sky as our wedding DJ! Chris and
                Sarah
                were a pleasure to work with from the very beginning of our planning process all the way through
                until
                the conclusion of our event. Even though some changes had to be made to our original plans due
                to
                Covid,
                they were extremely accommodating and kept everything running smoothly. They did an amazing job
                reading
                our crowd and kept our dance floor going, despite having a smaller crowd.

                We loved that they not only were able to DJ our reception, but also were able to play beautiful
                live
                music for our ceremony and cocktail hour (and all at a great price)! We would definitely
                recommend
                them
                to anyone looking for a DJ in the area.</p>

                Chris and Sarah provided the “best DJ party I have ever been to” according to my daughter Nili, who’s
                Bat
                Mitzvah we celebrated. It had the right number of games, special line dances, and the perfect music
                selection. The karaoke was phenomenal. Finally Chris and Sarah had the fun spirit and magnetism to
                energize
                the party and get the kids rockin.
                You were both such pleasures to work with. Thank you both!</p>

            <p>All 5 members of Castles in the Sky played at New London Counseling Center's fundraiser gala. I
                can’t
                say
                enough about the enthusiasm, flexibility, kindness, and of course the awesome TALENT possessed
                by
                every
                band member. By the time of our fundraiser, I felt like I knew them - we were so privileged to
                have
                them
                at the Gala. I first contacted them via this website and I received a quick and informative
                response
                from Sarah. Their pricing is very competitive for all that they provide. Everything they did
                from
                pre-event communications, lighting, sound, playlist, and last but not least, their incredible
                sound
                was
                top notch. The music was incredible and got people up dancing. I totally recommend them and am
                hoping to
                hire them for our 2022 event!!!! Thank you all, Lisa O.

                Wow where do I begin with how much I love Sarah and Christian. They helped me propose to my
                girlfriend
                (now Fiancé). They took so much care into writing the perfect mashup between our two songs then
                performed it in Philadelphia to create the perfect romantic moment for our proposal. They were
                so
                easy
                to communicate with. They also were so organized with the details and planning. MOST IMPORTANTLY
                THEY
                ARE SOOOOOO TALENTED. Sarah’s voice left us in awe and Christian’s guitar talent was wild. They
                were
                perfect for the special moment.</p>

                We didn't want to have a DJ for our wedding reception so we explored other options and decided to go
                with a
                live band. We signed up with Sarah and Chris and are so happy we did. They were so responsive from the
                get-go with pricing and what they would be able to provide. They were flexible with our needs and
                responsive
                to any concerns or questions we had. They completely exceeded any expectations we had the day of as
                well.
                Their voices are amazing. They also went the extra mile to accommodate us. We would highly recommend
                them to
                anyone.</p>
