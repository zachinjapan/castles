            <h1>Special Video Package</h1>
            <p>
              Chris and Sarah (founders of Castles in the Sky) have been married
              for years now. But they remember how expensive it was to get a
              photographer and videographer for their wedding. And after the
              additional expense, what do you get? A 3-5 minute highlight reel
              of your wedding and a $3,000 bill. There’s got to be a better way.
              In an effort to help couples stay on budget we developed a video
              package that captures all of the special moments at your wedding.
              The best part is it costs a few hundred dollars instead of a few
              thousand! Included is a multi-camera view of your ceremony, first
              dance/special dances and toast speeches. We also bring an entire
              portable recording studio to make sure the audio is recorded
              properly and not a single word is missed. Then we mix and master
              everything together so you have a digital video of your wedding
              that lasts forever. Contact us for details and pricing.

            <h1>After Party</h1>
            <p>
              Looking to keep the party going after the reception? We handle
              that too. Most wedding venues hover around five hours per event.
              This leaves little time to spend with the people who really matter
              to you, or that you may not get to see often. Just about every
              option available for your wedding is available for an after party.
              One popular option is to have all those truly wonderful friends
              over for a karaoke party. Or, just keep the jams going, have a
              late night photo booth party and dance the night away. You only
              get married once so we think everyone might as well enjoy the
              party.
